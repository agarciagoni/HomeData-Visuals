# Kitchen-visual
Here we will include all the code aiming to show the data gathered from the Piccolo Kitchen project. https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/piccolo-kitchen/overview/

***Need Update***

In this first iteration we have used Dash tool from plotly to show the first live data from three terMITes.

The graphs in the left side show live data from Temperature, Humidity and Light Intensity from a terMITe placed in the kitchen top.

The three different indicators in the right side show information every 5 seconds (customizable) from three terMITes placed in the kitchen top, the back cabinet, and the top cabinet of the Piccolo Kitchen.


The sensors included in the project and their codes are included in this other repository: https://github.com/agarciagoni/HomeData
